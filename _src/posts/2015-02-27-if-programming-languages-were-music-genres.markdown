    Title: If programming languages were music genres

There are quite some posts out there that compare programming languages to
something else, like religions, rock bands, types of women ... There is a
[compilation of these over at Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3133).

One comparison that I find missing is that of programming languages to music
genres (maybe the "Subcultures" post was simmilar, but it seems to be a dead
link now).  This is the more surprising since it looks like developers tend to
argue about their favourite languages just like most people about music:
everyone knows it is a highly subjective preference, but no-one escapes trying
to convince others that they are not listening to the "right" music!

So, here is my (completely subjective) view on programming languages as music
genres:

<!-- more -->

- **C: punk rock** It only has three chords, it was born in the late 70's, and,
  despite several reports to the contrary, it is not dead yet.
- **C++: heavy metal** It claims to be similar but more technical than C, it is
  subdivided in dozens of different subgenres that you will never totally
  master, and despite the whole technical allure, at some point you start
  thinking it is a bit commercial and superficial.
- **Java: techno** No one likes it really, but peer pressure drives you at some
  point to go to a place where they are playing it loudly, and you have to do
  as if you enjoy it.
- **Python: blues rock** It does what C does, but slower and with one and two
  more chords thrown here and there.  Everyone likes it for a while, but then,
  after some hours of listening to it, you start wondering if there is something
  else.
- **Ruby: reggae** Coming from an exotic place, it has gained mainstream
  acceptance, it is as slow as Python, and people in that scene tend to regard
  themselves as cool without further explanation.
- **LISP: classical music** Someone in a position of authority told you long
  ago to learn its basics because it was important for your education, you
  thought at the time that it was a hateful and obsolete past-time, but as time
  goes by, you go back to it and find comfort in its beauty.
- **Haskell: mathcore** Not everyone knows it, and those who do think they are
  some kind of elite.  It is 100% faster and more complex than anything else
  out there.  It is several layers of purity removed from C, although they
  share some distant roots.
- **Erlang: world music** A lot of different musical styles thrown together and
  whose unifying trait seems to be that, apparently, very few people listen to
  them.
- **Clojure: hip hop** The base is made with the same tools as techno, but with
  old soul records played on top.  Who would have thought that those sweet
  performers from Motown sounded so aggresive when played with a bad attitude?
- **Scala: rap rock** It tries to bring together the best of two worlds and it
  largely succeeds.  The hardcore fans of each camp will deny there is any need
  to blend their styles together, but from time to time find themselves
  listening to it and nodding.
