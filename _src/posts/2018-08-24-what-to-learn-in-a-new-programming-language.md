This is a list of practical tasks that I learn in any language. Each point
builds more or less on top of the previous ones.

- write a unittest
- read a configuration file
- parse command line arguments
- pass arguments to different functions
- logging
- write to a database
- run concurrent processes
- monitoring of a server process
- reporting/alerting
- create a GUI
- create a web interface
- create a REST interface
- create an installer/deployable app
